Text file reader for Windows Mobile handheld devices with touch screen and no keyboard. With a very simple interface.

Features:
  * renders plain text files (.txt) and SFB text files (.sfb); at this point does not support images, tables and the footnotes are "as is" (inline); maybe it will open FB2 (.xml) files in the future
  * can handle very large files with low memory footprint
  * adaptive autoscrolling
  * recognizes finger-flick
  * autosave of current position
  * user bookmarks
  * recent files
  * browse TOC (for SFB files)

Requires .NET CF 3.5 to be installed on the device.

Still under development but definitely usable.
